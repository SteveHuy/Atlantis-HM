# ðŸ§± Userdoc Project Guideline

This guide indicates how you MUST implement implementation plans from markdown documents. These documents will start with Userdoc Implementation Plan

You will be given implementation plans which are markdown documents that contain all of the steps you need to implement an epic within the system. Ensure when you are implementing the plan you DO NOT effect any code that is not effected by the epic within the implementation plan.

Within the implementation plan there will be "#" which are requirements in Userdoc - you should retrieve those requirements via MCP to get their full details if you cannot connect to the MCP stop immediately and respond with "I cannot access Userdoc".

If the implementation plan does not contain # that is referenced in the requirements you got from Userdoc add a comment where that requirement would be with "UD-REF: # Requirement." This will be implemented in a future epic

Please autonomously complete these tasks, ensuring you retrieve the requirements and implement.

Make sure to make frequent git commits with descriptive messages as you go through
