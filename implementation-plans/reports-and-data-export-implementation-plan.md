Userdoc Implementation Plan

# 1. #Download Reports

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Integrate Download Reports Button**
   - On the #View Medical Records screen, add a prominent "Download Reports" button for Patients.

2. **Report Type Selection Dialog**
   - On click, open a modal or sheet presenting a checklist of available report types:
     - Visit Summaries, Lab Results, Medications, Immunizations (use mock data for each).
   - Allow selection of one or more report types.

3. **Download Process and Validation**
   - Add a "Download" button within the modal.
   - On click:
     - Validate that at least one report type is selected.
       - If not, show validation error: 'Please select at least one report to download'.
     - If valid:
       - Simulate generating the selected reports as a downloadable PDF file (mock the data and file generation; actual backend not required).
       - Trigger file download (use a mock PDF, e.g., `generateMockPdf()`).
       - Show success message: 'Reports downloaded successfully'.
   - After completion, automatically close modal and navigate to #View Medical Records.

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - Indicate that all data exports comply with privacy and HIPAA standards (banner or note).
   - Mock all export logic, but comment where secure API or audit logging would occur.

5. **Codebase References**
   - From the root, search for any `UD-REF: #Download Reports` and update with new implementation.
   - For any referenced but not yet implemented stories, leave comments (e.g., `// UD-REF: #View Medical Records`).

# 2. #Generate Patient Statements

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Statement Generation UI**
   - Add a "Generate Patient Statement" section for Receptionists.
   - Patient selection via searchable dropdown (mock list of patients with name + ID).
   - Date range selectors for "From" and "To" (date inputs).

2. **Statement Generation Flow**
   - On "Generate Statement" click:
     - Fetch and compile billing information for the selected patient within the date range (mock data).
     - Display a preview of the statement including:
       - Patient details, itemized charges, payments made, current balance.

3. **Send Statement Flow**
   - "Send Statement" button opens a modal to select delivery method:
     - 'Email': Simulate sending statement as PDF attachment to the patient's registered email.
       - Show 'Statement sent successfully'.
     - 'Postal Mail': Simulate queuing for print and mailing.
       - Show 'Statement queued for mailing'.

4. **Logging and Audit**
   - Each statement generation/sending action updates the mock #User Activity Logs Table (include patient, date range, action, user).

5. **Validation & Security**
   - Validate patient selection and date range.
   - Ensure no actual PII is handled in mock; comment for future secure backend handling.

6. **Codebase References**
   - From root, update all `UD-REF: #Generate Patient Statements` to reference implementation.
   - Comment for referenced but missing features as needed (e.g., `// UD-REF: #User Activity Logs Table`).

# 3. #Generate Daily Reports

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Daily Reports Section UI**
   - Provide a section for Receptionists to generate daily reports.
   - Dropdown for report type: 'Appointments', 'Payments', 'Claims'.
   - Date input for selecting report date.

2. **Report Generation Flow**
   - On "Generate Report" click:
     - Compile relevant mock data for the chosen report type and date.
     - Display a preview with summary and detailed breakdown.

3. **Download & Email Options**
   - "Download Report" button generates the report as a mock PDF file for download.
   - "Email Report" button:
     - Opens email entry modal.
     - Simulate sending the report as a PDF attachment.
     - Show confirmation: 'Report sent successfully'.

4. **Logging**
   - Every generation and distribution action logs to #User Activity Logs Table.

5. **Validation & Security**
   - Validate report type and date selection.
   - Banner for privacy/compliance.
   - Mock all data, with comments for future secure API handling.

6. **Codebase References**
   - Search root for `UD-REF: #Generate Daily Reports` and update references.
   - Add placeholder/comments for external dependencies (`// UD-REF: #User Activity Logs Table`).

# 4. #Create Visit Summary Report

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Visit Summary Creation UI**
   - UI for Service Providers to create a visit summary.
   - Include:
     - Encounter data, diagnoses, treatments (all mock fields).
     - Customizable sections for medications prescribed, tests/results, follow-up instructions (checkboxes/toggles).

2. **Report Compilation and Review**
   - "Generate Report" button:
     - Compile input into a readable summary preview.
     - Validate all required sections; show specific messages if incomplete or errors are found.
     - Allow editing before finalizing.

3. **Finalization & Patient Access**
   - On finalize:
     - Save the report to mock patient's EHR (mock data only).
     - Enable patient access via #View Medical Records.
     - Offer download as PDF or mock secure sharing.
     - Log action in audit log and send mock notification to patient.

4. **Audit and Notification**
   - Each report action logs to mock audit log.
   - Simulate notification to patient (UI feedback).

5. **Validation, Security, and Compliance**
   - Ensure only required roles can generate reports.
   - Indicate all processes comply with privacy standards.
   - Mock data only—comment on backend integration points.

6. **Codebase References**
   - Search root for `UD-REF: #Create Visit Summary Report` and update.
   - Add references for any unimplemented features (e.g., `// UD-REF: #View Medical Records`).

# 5. #Order Imaging Studies

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Order Imaging Studies Form**
   - "Order Imaging Studies" heading for Service Providers.
   - Form fields:
     - Patient ID (dropdown, required, mock linked to #View Patient EHR)
     - Study Type (dropdown: X-ray, MRI, CT scan)
     - Clinical Indication (text, required, max 256 chars)
     - Priority Level (dropdown: Routine, Urgent, Stat)

2. **Order Submission Flow**
   - "Submit Order" button:
     - Validate all fields; show validation errors for missing/incorrect fields.
     - On valid:
       - Simulate order transmission to radiology system (mock).
       - Show confirmation: 'Imaging study ordered successfully'.

   - Show current status for each ordered study (mock status updates).
   - Allow view of imaging results within mock EHR.

3. **Security & Compliance**
   - Banner/note for secure data transmission and HIPAA compliance.
   - Ensure data is "securely" handled in mock (comments for future API integration).

4. **Navigation and References**
   - After order, allow navigation back to #View Patient EHR.
   - Search from root for `UD-REF: #Order Imaging Studies` and update references.
   - Add references for unimplemented features (e.g., `// UD-REF: #View Patient EHR`).

**General Guidelines for All Features**

- Use only mock/in-memory data—**no DB migrations** or real integrations.
- UI should follow Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui conventions.
- Use strong validation for all forms (recommend `zod` for schemas).
- All downloadable/exported files are simulated.
- Security, audit, and logging are mocked but commented for where true secure integrations are expected.
- Accessibility and responsive design must be ensured throughout.
- **Always search from the root of the codebase** for feature references and update/remove as you implement.
- For any referenced story not in this plan, search the codebase, leverage if present, or leave a `UD-REF` comment for future implementation.
