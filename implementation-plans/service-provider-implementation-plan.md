- Whenever a referenced #Feature is not in this plan, check for its existence and reuse if present; otherwise, leave UD-REF as per guidelines.
- All UI and flows use mock data only; do not build real backend or database integration at this stage.
- Ensure all UI follows accessibility and security best practices per technical guidelines.
