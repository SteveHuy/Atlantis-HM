# Userdoc Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan covers the Insurance and Claims Management features for the healthcare management system. The features enable patients to submit insurance details, receptionists and service providers to verify coverage, submit claims, and track claim status.

# 1. Insurance Data Model and Infrastructure Setup

## Database Schema Design
- Create insurance provider table with predefined list of providers
- Create patient insurance details table (provider_id, policy_number, status, verification_date)
- Create insurance claims table (claim_id, patient_id, encounter_id, amount, status, submission_date)
- Create claim status history table for tracking status changes
- Create insurance eligibility cache table for storing verification results

## Mock Data Setup
- Populate insurance providers list with common providers (Blue Cross, Aetna, UnitedHealth, etc.)
- Create mock insurance verification API responses for different scenarios
- Generate sample claim IDs and tracking numbers
- Create mock claim status transitions (submitted → processing → approved/denied)
- Set up mock eligibility check responses with coverage limits and copay information

## API Integration Foundation
- Set up mock insurance verification endpoints
- Create mock claim submission endpoints (HIPAA 5010 format simulation)
- Implement mock real-time eligibility checking service
- Create webhook simulation for claim status updates

## Security and Authorization
- Implement role-based access control for insurance features
- Ensure patient data encryption for insurance information
- Add audit trail logging for all insurance-related actions
- Implement secure storage for policy numbers and sensitive data
