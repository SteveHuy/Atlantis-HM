Userdoc Implementation Plan

# 1. #Secure Messaging

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **UI Construction**
   - Add a "Messages" link to the main navigation for Patient users.
   - Implement a "Messages" page displaying:
     - Heading: "Messages"
     - "Compose New Message" button
     - List of sent/received messages (mock data; thread view on click)

2. **Compose Message Flow**
   - On clicking "Compose New Message," display a modal/form with:
     - Recipient (dropdown, mock list of providers)
     - Subject (text input, max 128 chars)
     - Message Content (textarea, required, max 1024 chars)
     - Attachment upload (accept images/docs, max 5MB, file type validation)
     - "Send" button

3. **Validation and Submission**
   - Validate all fields client-side (with zod or equivalent):
     - Recipient required, subject ≤128 chars, content required ≤1024 chars, file type/size for attachments
   - On error: display contextual error messages and require user correction before proceeding.
   - On success:
     - Simulate secure message submission (mock function, log entry for audit trail).
     - Show confirmation message and update message lists.
     - All messages should be stored "encrypted" in mock data (simulate using obfuscated text).

4. **Message List and Threads**
   - List all sent/received messages, showing sender, recipient, preview, and timestamp.
   - On click: open thread view (full message, previous replies if any).
   - Support attachments (mock download link/preview).
   - Simulate real-time updates by refreshing mock data.

5. **Compliance and Security Considerations**
   - All mock messages should display a privacy banner referencing HIPAA compliance.
   - Clearly indicate that communication is "secure and encrypted" (simulate in mock only).
   - Comments in code where real encryption and audit logging should occur.

6. **Audit Trail**
   - Each message action (send/receive) should update a mock audit log (sender, recipient, timestamp, action).
   - Ensure mock audit log is used across all secure messaging flows.

7. **References and Codebase Consistency**
   - **From the root of the codebase**, search and update any instances of `UD-REF: #Secure Messaging` to reference the new implementation.
   - For referenced stories not in this plan (e.g., #Secure Communication), search codebase and leverage or leave `UD-REF: #Secure Communication` if not yet implemented.

# 2. #Secure Messaging with Patients

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Provider Messaging UI**
   - Implement "Secure Messaging" heading and messaging interface for Service Providers.
   - Display a list of patient messages (use mock patient data).
   - Allow selection of a patient; show conversation history and message input.

2. **Message Composition**
   - Message input (textarea, required, max 1024 chars).
   - "Send Message" button; validate content is not empty.
   - Support for attachments (mock only, same restrictions as above).
   - On valid send: show 'Message sent successfully' and update message thread.

3. **Audit & Notifications**
   - On send, update mock audit trail and display confirmation.
   - Simulate notification banner for new messages.
   - All messages "encrypted" (mock obfuscation).
   - Display privacy notice for HIPAA compliance.

4. **View History and Navigation**
   - Support full communication history per patient.
   - "Back" navigates to #View Patient EHR (UD-REF: #View Patient EHR, add or reference as needed).

5. **Codebase References**
   - From root, update all references to `UD-REF: #Secure Messaging with Patients`.
   - For referenced stories not in this plan, add or leave comments as needed.

# 3. #Log Patient Communications

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Logging Interface**
   - Provide UI for logging communications (Receptionist role).
   - Fields:
     - Patient ID (text, required, mock validation against existing patients)
     - Communication details (textarea, required, max 2048 chars)
     - Auto-generated timestamp
   - "Log Communication" button

2. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - On invalid Patient ID: show 'Invalid Patient ID'
   - All fields must be complete; display errors inline.

3. **Audit and Activity Logs**
   - On success, entry is saved to mock User Activity Logs (log_id, user_id, action_performed, timestamp).
   - Show success message and update audit trail.
   - Each log is linked to the corresponding patient for history view.

4. **Log Viewing & Filtering**
   - Interface to view past communications for a Patient ID.
   - Support filtering by date or type (mock filter).
   - Protect access via role-based checks (Receptionist only, mock permission check).

5. **Secure Integration**
   - Directly integrates with message logs from #Secure Communication (reference mock data/shared structures).
   - Add comments for future real API/log integration.

6. **Codebase Search**
   - From root, update all references for `UD-REF: #Log Patient Communications`.
   - Reference or comment on any required but not implemented features (e.g., #Secure Communication).

# 4. #Secure Communication

## High-Level Implementation Steps

1. **Messaging Interface for Receptionist**
   - Secure message UI: select recipient (dropdown, mock providers/staff), message content (textarea, required, max 4096 chars).
   - "Send" button with required validation (content cannot be empty).
   - Show success banner on send.

2. **Audit Trail and Message Table**
   - On send, update mock message table (sender_id, recipient_id, content, timestamp).
   - Add to mock audit log as well.

3. **Encryption and Privacy**
   - Simulate encryption for messages (store mock obfuscated text).
   - Display privacy notice for secure messaging and compliance.
   - All message displays include sender, recipient, timestamp.

4. **Sorting, Status, and History**
   - Allow sorting by date or recipient (mock filter/sort).
   - On read, update status to 'Read' in mock data.
   - Provide full history/log view.

5. **Codebase References**
   - From root, update any references to `UD-REF: #Secure Communication`.
   - Ensure all integration points are clearly commented for real API integration.

**General Notes Across All Features**

- **Security/Compliance:**  
  - All flows must visually and structurally comply with HIPAA (mock only—real implementation must encrypt, log, and restrict access per technical guidelines).
  - All inputs must be validated client-side using a robust library (zod or equivalent) to simulate API contract.
  - Role-based permissions are to be enforced in mock data/UI flows.
- **Mock Data Only:**  
  - No actual DB migrations or API connections—use in-memory or static mock data, but design flows as if ready for backend integration.
- **Accessibility/UX:**  
  - Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and clear feedback states.
  - Ensure keyboard and screen reader support.
- **Testing:**  
  - Manually test all validation, message, and log flows with different mock roles.
- **Codebase Maintenance:**  
  - Always search **from the root** for all prior references and update or comment as per new implementation.
  - Leave placeholders/comments for any referenced but not yet implemented stories.
