**All features should use mock data and follow your projectâ€™s Next.js, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui guidelines. No backend/API or migration changes required for UI build. All actions should have appropriate field validation, access control, and feedback messages for the user.**

Let me know if you want deeper breakdowns, wireframes, or acceptance test cases for any of these features!
