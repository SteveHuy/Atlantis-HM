  a.href = url;
  a.download = `medical-records-summary-${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.json`;
  document.body.appendChild(a);
  a.click();
  document.body.removeChild(a);

2. ✅ Downloads as JSON file
3. ✅ Includes HIPAA compliance logging
4. ✅ Is properly integrated into the medical records UI

**Next Steps:**
For the Reports and Data Export epic implementation, the existing download functionality can be:
1. Enhanced to support multiple formats (PDF, CSV, etc.)
2. Extended with additional reporting options
3. Improved with better UI/UX for report selection
4. Connected to the new reports management system

No UD-REF comments need to be resolved as the feature is already fully implemented.
