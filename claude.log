SESSION MANAGEMENT FIX - Tue 15 Jul 2025 09:07:12 AEST
===============================
FOUND CRITICAL BUG: Multiple pages using incorrect session management

ISSUE: Several pages using localStorage.getItem() with custom keys instead of sessionManager.getSession()

AFFECTED PAGES:
- app/receptionist/patient-ehr/page.tsx (FIXED)
- app/provider/allergies/page.tsx 
- app/provider/encounter/page.tsx 
- app/provider/encounter-notes/page.tsx 
- app/provider/immunizations/page.tsx 
- app/provider/lab-results/page.tsx 
- app/provider/lab-tests/page.tsx 
- app/provider/referrals/page.tsx 

ROOT CAUSE: Using 'atlantis_provider_session' instead of 'userSession' key
FIX: Replace localStorage.getItem() with sessionManager.getSession()

STATUS: Starting fixes...

FIXES COMPLETED - Tue 15 Jul 2025 09:14:08 AEST
===================

- Broken pages: localStorage.getItem('atlantis_provider_session') → Wrong key

FIXED PAGES:
1. app/receptionist/patient-ehr/page.tsx ✅
2. app/provider/allergies/page.tsx ✅
3. app/provider/encounter/page.tsx ✅ 
4. app/provider/encounter-notes/page.tsx ✅
